This is the public api request Unit 5 project. It is designed to pull 
information from a third party server using AJAX request methods and 
display them as a gallery with relevant employee information, and 
gives functionality to each gallery div so that when clicked a 
modal window appears with further information regarding the 
'employee' displayed.

This is completed for the MEETS EXPECTATIONS grade, I attempted
some of the EXCEEDS functionality, which I've left in the code,
however, I have not added the previous and next buttons to the modal.
